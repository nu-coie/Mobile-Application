## Widgets Used

The app leverages several Flutter widgets to enhance the user experience:

- **Timer**: Used for time-related functionality, such as delaying actions.
- **Navigator.push**: Facilitates navigation between screens in the app.
- **Center**: Positions its child in the center of the screen.
- **Container**: An all-purpose box for encapsulating and styling UI elements.
- **Position**: Positions a child within a stack relative to the stack's boundaries.
 - **DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch**: Converts milliseconds since epoch to a DateTime object.
 - **Column**: Organizes UI components vertically for a clean layout.
- **SafeArea**: Ensures that UI elements are positioned within the safe area of the screen.
- **Padding**: Adds padding around its child.
- **Icon**: Represents a graphical icon for better usability.
- **TextField**: Enables users to input text, like city names.
- **TextButton**: Provides a clickable button with text.

## Design Inspiration

The design of this app is crafted to provide a seamless user experience. There are two versions of the app :

- **Home_Page Version**: Users are directed to a separate City Page to input the city name for weather updates.
- **Home_PageV2 Version**: Streamlines city search by removing the City Page and allowing users to input the city name directly on the Home Page.
