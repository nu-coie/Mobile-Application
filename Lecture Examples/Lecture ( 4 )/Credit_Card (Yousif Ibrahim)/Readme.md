# Changes Suggested by Yousif Ibrahim 

This section highlights the key change proposed by Yousif Ibrahim to enhance the functionality and user experience of the app. His improvement focuses on making a specific section of the UI scrollable while keeping the rest of the content static.

Yousif suggested introducing a scrollable area specifically for the list of Plans , while ensuring that other parts of the UI remain static. This is achieved by wrapping the ListView in a Container with a fixed height of 400. As a result, only the Plan  section becomes scrollable, providing a more structured and focused layout.

## Original Code: 
The entire screen, including the non-plan content, was scrollable since the ListView was used directly within the Scaffold.

## Yousif's Code: 
By containing the ListView within a Container of fixed height, Yousif's idea makes only the plan section scrollable, leaving the rest of the UI (like the header and buttons) static. This provides a cleaner and more intuitive user experience, where only relevant content is scrollable.
